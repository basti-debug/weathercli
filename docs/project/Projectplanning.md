# Projectplanning

Provide a short description how you approached the planning of the tasks and which tools you used.

In addition please provide your current state of your tasks. I am ok with several ways of providing that information:

- added into the project same as this documentation
- linked to a tool which is availalbe for me (e.g. github-project-boards, trello-boards, ...)
- included into this documentation as a csv/excel file
- ...

You just have to check if you fullfill the following requirements:

- the task name is visible
- a short description for the task is availalbe
