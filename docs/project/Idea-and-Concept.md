# Idea and Concept

WeatherCLI is a project which was started as a schoolproject. We wanted to check the weatherforecast in the windows console. This is done with a freemium-API, which is provided by _AerisWeather_, one of the best weather-APIs on the market. The Location can either be set manually or the location of the deivce can be determined via GPS.
