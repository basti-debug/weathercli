# weathercli

A helpful weather programm, in a console with custom alerts, integrations etc.

Uses https://github.com/LarsVomMars/Checkboxes Checkboxes to select the functions 
Uses https://rapidapi.com/natkapral/api/ip-geo-location/ as the weather api 
Uses System.Device.Location for device location.

Planned Features for Version 1: 

start the programm there you have the weather for you current position

you have the options to change the location, set custom alerts, or go to the options 

the current weather will be displayed with a little forecast in ascii text art style 


* custom weather alerts:

  you have the choice to select between setting a alert for a selected position in a selected interval 
  like, you get a notification every morning that how the weather is now outside and how it will be today
  
  or a notification everytime the weather changes at a certain position, like when the weather changes at the lake, so you can go for a swim
