# WeatherCLI

**_WeatherCLI_** is a **turnkey** solution for checking the weather and getting forecasts in the commandline. The location of the forecasted region can be typed in manually (for those who are _data-safety-aficionados_), or the application can use your devices **GPS** for accurate location measurements.
